Never, Fox-Trot (Paul Denniker) - Bert Lown and his Hotel Biltmore Orch., Vocal refrain by male trio (Elmer Feldkamp + 2), Victor 1931

NOTE: Here's one more recording of my favorite band of the American Jazz Age!  Bert Lown's is one of those bands which listening to never bores. His arrangements and instrumentalisations are so rich, like the multitude of little details in the old masters' paintings: each time you are looking at them, you find something new and refreshing for your spirit.  And this rendition is no exception. Enjoy it!
